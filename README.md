# Trivia Now Application

This is my take on creating a trivia application to educate the world and make it a little smarter. The questions come from a [trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) with all sorts of questions. Check out the app [here](https://trivia-now.netlify.com/).

## Getting Started

### Selecting the number of questions

First, select the number of questions you'd like to go through, then hit "Go".

### Rules

* Your score is calculated based on your **first** click, where one point is awarded if the correct answer is chosen and zero for everything else. If you get the answer wrong, you are encouraged to keep guessing until you get the correct one (this is designed to help you learn new facts) before hitting **"next"**.
* Have fun and keep learning!
